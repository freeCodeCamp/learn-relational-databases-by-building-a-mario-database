# Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database

> Welcome to the Relational Database Lessons!

## 10. Start the Terminal

### 10.1

**The first thing you need to do is start the terminal.** Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type `echo hello PostgreSQL` into the terminal and press enter.

#### HINTS

- Capitalization matters
- If the tests don't run automatically, try typing `exit` into the terminal and redoing the instructions

## 20. Login

### 20.1

Your virtual machine comes with PostgreSQL installed. You will use the Psql terminal application to interact with it. Log in by typing `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` into the terminal and pressing enter.

#### HINTS

- Capitalization matters
- Type `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` into the terminal and press enter
- If the terminal isn't open, find the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the window, navigate to the "Terminal" tab, and click "New Terminal"

## 30. View Databases

### 30.1

Notice that the prompt changed to let you know that you are now interacting with PostgreSQL. First thing to do is see what databases are here. Type `\l` into the prompt to **l**ist them.

#### HINTS

- Type `\l` into the psql prompt and press enter
- Type `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` into the terminal to log in to psql if you aren't logged in first

## 40. Create `first_database`

### 40.1

The databases you see are there by default. You can make your own like this:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

The capitalized words are keywords telling PostgreSQL what to do. The name of the database is the lowercase word. Note that **all commands need a semi-colon at the end.** Create a new database named `first_database`.

#### HINTS

- Don't forget the semi-colon at the end
- Type `CREATE DATABASE first_database;` into the psql prompt and press enter
- Type `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` into the terminal to log in to psql if you aren't logged in first

## 50. View `first_database`

### 50.1

Use the **l**ist shortcut command again to make sure your new database is there.

#### HINTS

- Type `\` followed by the "list" shortcut letter
- Enter `\l` into the psql prompt and press enter
- Type `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` into the terminal to log in to psql if you aren't logged in first

## 60. Create `second_database`

### 60.1

It worked. Your new database is there. If you don't get a message after entering a command, it means it's incomplete and you likely forgot the semi-colon. You can just add it on the next line and press enter to finish the command. Create another database named `second_database`.

#### HINTS

- Use the "CREATE DATABASE" keywords
- Here's the example again: `CREATE DATABASE database_name;`
- Don't forget the semi-colon
- Try entering `CREATE DATABASE second_database;`
- Type `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` into the terminal to log in to psql if you aren't logged in first

## 70. View Databases

### 70.1

You should have another new database now. **L**ist the databases to make sure.

#### HINTS

- Use the **l**ist shortcut command
- Enter `\l` into the prompt
- Type `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` into the terminal to log in to psql if you aren't logged in first

## 80. Connect to `second_database`

### 80.1

You can **c**onnect to a database by entering `\c database_name`. You need to connect to add information. Connect to your `second_database`.

#### HINTS

- Enter `\c second_database` into the psql prompt to connect
- Type `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres` into the terminal to log in to psql if you aren't logged in first

## 90. View `second_database` Tables

### 90.1

You should see a message that you are connected. Notice that the prompt changed to `second_database=>`. So the `postgres=>` prompt before must have meant you were connected to that database. A database is made of tables that hold your data. Enter `\d` to **d**isplay the tables.

#### HINTS

- Type `\d` in the prompt and press enter
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 100. Create `first_table`

### 100.1

Looks like there's no tables or relations yet. Similar to how you created a database, you can create a table like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name();
```

Note that the parenthesis are needed for this one. It will create the table in the database you are connected to. Create a table named `first_table` in `second_database`.

#### HINTS

- Enter `CREATE TABLE first_table();` into the prompt
- Don't forget the semi-colon
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 110. View `second_database` Tables

### 110.1

View the tables in `second_database` again with the **d**isplay command. You should see your new table there with a little meta data about it.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Try entering `\d` into the prompt
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 120. Create `second_table`

### 120.1

Create another new table in this database. Give it a name of `second_table`.

#### HINTS

- Use the "CREATE TABLE" keywords
- Don't forget the parenthesis and semi-colon at the end
- Here's an example: `CREATE TABLE table_name();`
- Enter `CREATE TABLE second_table();` into the prompt
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 130. View `second_database` Tables

### 130.1

There should be two tables in this database now. **D**isplay them again to make sure.

#### HINTS

- Use the **display** shortcut command
- Enter `\d` into the prompt
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 140. View `second_table` Details

### 140.1

You can view more details about a table by adding the table name after the **d**isplay command like this: `\d table_name`. View more details about your `second_table`.

#### HINTS

- Enter `\d second_table` into the prompt
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 150. Create `first_column`

### 150.1

Tables need **columns** to describe the data in them, yours doesn't have any yet. Here's an example of how to add one:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;
```

Add a column to `second_table` named `first_column`. Give it a data type of `INT`. `INT` stands for integer. Don't forget the semi-colon. :smile:

#### HINTS

- Try entering `ALTER TABLE second_table ADD COLUMN first_column INT;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 160. View `second_table` Details

### 160.1

Looks like it worked. **D**isplay the details of `second_table` again to see if your new column is there.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Put the table name after the command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d second_table`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 170. Add `id` Column

### 170.1

Your column is there :smile: Use `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` to add another column to `second_table` named `id` that's a type of `INT`.

#### HINTS

- Here's the example again: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;`
- Don't forget the semi-colon :wink:
- You added the last column with: `ALTER TABLE second_table ADD COLUMN first_column INT;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE second_table ADD COLUMN id INT;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 180. View `second_table` Details

### 180.1

Your table should have an `id` column added. View the details of `second_table` to make sure.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay command
- Add a table name after the **d**isplay command to view details
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d second_table`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 190. Add `age` Column

### 190.1

Add another column to `second_table` named `age`. Give it a data type of `INT`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- Here's the example again: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;`
- You added the last column with: `ALTER TABLE second_table ADD COLUMN id INT;`
- Try using `ALTER TABLE second_table ADD COLUMN age INT;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 200. View `second_table` Details

### 200.1

Take look at the details of `second_table` again.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Add the table name to the shortcut command to see details
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Enter `\d second_table`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 210. Drop `age` Column

### 210.1

Those are some good looking columns. You will probably need to know how to remove them. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

Drop your `age` column.

#### HINTS

- Try entering `ALTER TABLE second_table DROP COLUMN age;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 220. View `second_table` Details

### 220.1

View the details of `second_table` to see if it's gone.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Add the table name to the shortcut command to see details
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Enter `\d second_table`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 230. Drop `first_column` Column

### 230.1

It's gone. Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `DROP COLUMN` keywords again to drop `first_column`.

#### HINTS

- Here's the example again: `ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;`
- You dropped the last column with: `ALTER TABLE second_table DROP COLUMN age;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE second_table DROP COLUMN first_column;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 240. Add `name` Column

### 240.1

A common data type is `VARCHAR`. It's a short string of characters. You need to give it a maximum length when using it like this: `VARCHAR(30)`.

Add a new column to `second_table`, give it a name of `name` and a data type of `VARCHAR(30)`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;`
- You added the last column like this: `ALTER TABLE second_table ADD COLUMN age INT;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE second_table ADD COLUMN name VARCHAR(30);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 250. View `second_table` Details

### 250.1

Take look at the details of `second_table` to see your columns.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d second_table`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 260. Rename `name` Column

### 260.1

You can see the `VARCHAR` type there. The `30` means the data in it can a max of 30 characters. You named that column `name`, it should have been `username`. Here's how you can rename a column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name;
```

Rename the `name` column to `username`.

#### HINTS

- Use `second_table` as the table name, `name` as the column name, and `username` as the new name for the column
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE second_table RENAME COLUMN name TO username;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 270. View `second_table` Details

### 270.1

Take look at the details of `second_table` again to see if it got renamed.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Enter `\d second_table`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 280. Insert Samus Row

### 280.1

It worked. Rows are the actual data in the table. You can add one like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);
```

Insert a row into `second_table`. Give it an `id` of `1`, and a `username` of `Samus`. The username column expects a `VARCHAR`, so you need to put Samus in single quotes like this: `'Samus'`.

#### HINTS

- The table is `second_table`, the column names are `id` and `username`, and the values to add are `1` and `'Samus'`
- Don't forget the semi-colon
- Try entering `INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES(1, 'Samus');`
- If you missed a matching single quote, try entering `');` to finish the command and try again
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 290. View `second_table` Data

### 290.1

You should have one row in your table. You can view the data in a table by querying it with the `SELECT` statement. Here's how it looks:

```sql
SELECT columns FROM table_name;
```

Use a `SELECT` statement to view **all** the columns in `second_table`. Use an asterisk (`*`) to denote that you want to see all the columns.

#### HINTS

- Replace `columns` in the example with the all (`*`) symbol
- Use `second_table` as the table name
- Enter `SELECT * FROM second_table;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 300. Insert Mario Row

### 300.1

There's your one row. **Insert** another row **into** `second_table`. Fill in the `id` and `username` columns with the **values** `2` and `'Mario'`.

#### HINTS

- Here's the example: `INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);`
- Did you make `Mario` a string?
- You added the last row with `INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES(1, 'Samus');`
- Try entering `INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES(2, 'Mario');`
- If you missed a matching single quote, try entering `');` to finish the command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 310. View `second_table` Data

### 310.1

You should now have two rows in the table. Use `SELECT` again to view **all** the columns and rows **from** `second_table`.

#### HINTS

- Here's the example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM second_table;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 320. Insert Luigi Row

### 320.1

**Insert** another row **into** `second_table`. Use `3` as the `id`, and `Luigi` as the `username` this time.

#### HINTS

- Did you put `Luigi` in single quotes?
- Here's the example: `INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);`
- You added the last row with `INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES(2, 'Mario');`
- Try entering `INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES(3, 'Luigi');`
- If you missed a matching single quote, try entering `');` to finish the command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 330. View `second_table` Data

### 330.1

You should now have three rows. Use `SELECT` again to see **all** the data you entered.

#### HINTS

- Here's the example again: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM second_table;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 340. Delete Luigi Row

### 340.1

That gives me an idea :smiley: You can make a database of Mario video game characters. You should start from scratch for it. Why don't you delete the record you just entered. Here's an example of how to delete a row:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

Remove Luigi from your table. The condition you want to use is `username='Luigi'`.

#### HINTS

- Check your table name and condition closely
- Try entering `DELETE FROM second_table WHERE username='Luigi';`
- If you missed a matching single quote, try entering `');` to finish the command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 350. View `second_table` Data

### 350.1

Luigi should be gone. Use `SELECT` again to see all the data and make sure he's not there.

#### HINTS

- Here's the example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all the columns
- Try `SELECT * FROM second_table;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 360. Delete Mario Row

### 360.1

It's gone. You can scrap all this for the new database. **delete** Mario **from** `second_table` using the same command as before, except make the condition `username='Mario'` this time.

#### HINTS

- Use the `DELETE FROM` and `WHERE` keywords
- Here's the example: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
- You deleted Luigi with `DELETE FROM second_table WHERE username='Luigi';`
- Try entering `DELETE FROM second_table WHERE username='Mario';`
- If you missed a matching single quote, try entering `');` to finish the command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 370. Delete Samus Row

### 370.1

Only one more row should remain. **Delete** Samus **from** `second_table`.

#### HINTS

- Here's the example: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`
- You deleted Mario with `DELETE FROM second_table WHERE username='Mario';`
- Use `username='Samus'` as the condition
- Try entering `DELETE FROM second_table WHERE username='Samus';`
- If you missed a matching single quote, try entering `');` to finish the command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 380. View `second_table` Data

### 380.1

Use `SELECT` again to see all the rows in `second_table` to make sure they're gone.

#### HINTS

- Here's the example `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all columns
- Enter `SELECT * FROM second_table;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 390. View `second_table` Details

### 390.1

Looks like they're all gone. Remind yourself what columns you have in `second_table` by looking at its **d**etails.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Add the table name after the shortcut command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try `\d second_table`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 400. Drop `username` Column

### 400.1

There's two columns. You won't need either of them for the Mario database. **Alter** the **table** `second_table` and **drop** the **column** `username`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `DROP COLUMN` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;`
- You dropped a column before with: `ALTER TABLE second_table DROP COLUMN age;`
- Try `ALTER TABLE second_table DROP COLUMN username;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 410. Drop `id` Column

### 410.1

Next, drop the `id` column.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `DROP COLUMN` keywords

## 420. View `second_database` Tables

### 420.1

Okay, the table has no rows or columns left. View the tables in this database to see what is here.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- You don't need a table name with the command
- Try entering `\d`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 430. Drop `second_table`

### 430.1

Still two. You won't need either of those for the new database either. Drop `second_table` from your database. Here's an example:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

#### HINTS

- Enter `DROP TABLE second_table;` in the psql prompt
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 440. Drop `first_table`

### 440.1

Next, drop `first_table` from the database.

## 480. Connect to `mario_database`

### 480.1

**C**onnect to your newly named database so you can start adding your characters.

#### HINTS

- Use the `\c` shortcut command to connect to a database
- Add the database name after the command
- Here's an example: `\c database_name`
- Enter `\c mario_database`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=second_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 490. Drop `second_database`

### 490.1

Now that you aren't connected to `second_database`, you can drop it. Use the `DROP DATABASE` keywords to do that.

#### HINTS

- Add the database name after the keywords
- Don't forget the semi-colon
- Here's an example: `DROP DATABASE database_name;`
- Enter `DROP DATABASE second_database;`

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Try entering `\d`
- Try entering `\c mario_database`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 540. Create `characters` Table

Create a new table name `characters`, it will hold some basic information about Mario characters.

#### HINTS

- Use the `CREATE TABLE` keywords
- Don't forget the parenthesis and semi-colon at the end
- Here's an example: `CREATE TABLE table_name();`
- Try entering `CREATE TABLE characters();`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 550. Add `character_id` column

### 550.1

Next, you can add some columns to the table. Add a column named `character_id` to your new table that is a type of `SERIAL`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name TYPE;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE characters ADD COLUMN character_id SERIAL;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 560. View `characters` Details

### 560.1

The `SERIAL` type will make your column an `INT` with a `NOT NULL` constraint, and automatically increment the integer when a new row is added. View the details of the `characters` table to see what `SERIAL` did for you.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d characters`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 570. Add `name` Column

### 570.1

Add a column to `characters` called `name`. Give it a data type of `VARCHAR(30)`, and a constraint of `NOT NULL`. Add a constraint by putting it right after the data type.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE CONSTRAINT;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE characters ADD COLUMN name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL;` in the psql prompt
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

You can make another for where they are from. Add another column named `homeland`. Give it a data type of `VARCHAR` that has a max length of `60`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE characters ADD COLUMN homeland VARCHAR(60);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 590. Add `favorite_color` Column

### 590.1

Video game characters are quite colorful. Add one more column named `favorite_color`. Make it a `VARCHAR` with a max length of `30`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE characters ADD COLUMN favorite_color VARCHAR(30);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 600. View `characters` Details

### 600.1

You should have four columns in `characters`. Take a look at the details of it to see how things are going.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Add a table name to the shortcut command to see details
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d characters`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 610. Insert Mario Row

### 610.1

You are ready to start adding some rows. First is Mario. Earlier, you used this command to add a row:

```sql
INSERT INTO second_table(id, username) VALUES(1, 'Samus');
```

The first parenthesis are the column names, you can put as many columns as you want. The second parenthesis are values for those columns. Add a row to your table, give it a `name` of `Mario`, a `homeland` of `Mushroom Kingdom`, and a `favorite_color` of `Red`. Make sure to use single quotes where needed.

#### HINTS

- Here's an example: `INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2, column3) VALUES(value1, value2, value3);`
- Try using `INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES('Mario', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Red');`
- If you missed a matching single quote, try entering `');` to finish the command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 620. View `characters` Data

### 620.1

Mario should have a row now and his `character_id` should have been automatically added. View **all** the data in your `characters` table with `SELECT` to see.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM characters;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 630. Insert Luigi Row

### 630.1

Add another row for Luigi. Give it a `name` of `Luigi`, a `homeland` of `Mushroom Kingdom`, and a `favorite_color` of `Green`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES` keywords
- Here's an example: `INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2, column3) VALUES(value1, value2, value3);`
- Don't forget the quotes and semi-colon
- Try using `INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES('Luigi', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green');`
- If you missed a matching single quote, try entering `');` to finish the command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 640. View `characters` Data

### 640.1

View all the data in your `characters` table with `SELECT` again.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM characters;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 650. Insert Peach Row

### 650.1

Okay, it looks like it's all working. Add another row for Peach. Give her the values: `Peach`, `Mushroom Kingdom`, and `Pink`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES` keywords
- Here's an example: `INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2, column3) VALUES(value1, value2, value3);`
- Don't forget the quotes and semi-colon
- Try using `INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES('Peach', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Pink');`
- If you missed a matching single quote, try entering `');` to finish the command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 660. Add Toadstool and Bowser Rows

### 660.1

Adding rows one at a time is quite tedious. Here's an example of how you could have added the previous three rows at once:

```sql
INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color)
VALUES('Mario', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Red'),
('Luigi', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green'),
('Peach', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Pink');
```

Add two more rows. Give the first one values of: `Toadstool`, `Mushroom Kingdom`, and `Red`. Give the second one: `Bowser`, `Mushroom Kingdom`, and `Green`. Try to add them with one command.

#### HINTS

- Make sure you added commas and quotes where needed
- Try entering `INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES('Toadstool', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Red'), ('Bowser', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green');` in the psql prompt
- If you missed a matching single quote, try entering `');` to finish the command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 670. Add Daisy and Yoshi Rows

### 670.1

If you don't get a message after a command, it is likely incomplete. This is because you can put a command on multiple lines. Add two more rows. Give the first one values of: `Daisy`, `Sarasaland`, and `Yellow`. The second: `Yoshi`, `Dinosaur Land`, and `Green`. Try to do it with one command.

#### HINTS

- Make sure you added commas and quotes where needed
- You previously used `INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES('Toadstool', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Red'), ('Bowser', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green');`
- Try entering `INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES('Daisy', 'Sarasaland', 'Yellow'), ('Yoshi', 'Dinosaur Land', 'Green');`
- If you missed a matching single quote, try entering `');` to finish the command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 680. View `characters` Data

### 680.1

Take a look all the data in your table with `SELECT` to see where you stand.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all columns
- Try `SELECT * FROM characters;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 690. Update Daisy's `favorite_color`

### 690.1

It looks good, but there's a few mistakes. You can change a value like this:

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition;
```

You used `username='Samus'` as a condition earlier. `SET` Daisy's `favorite_color` to `Orange`. You can use the condition `name='Daisy'` to change her row.

#### HINTS

- There should be two sets of single quotes in this command
- Without the keywords, it looks like this: `characters favorite_color='Orange' name='Daisy';`
- Try `UPDATE characters SET favorite_color='Orange' WHERE name='Daisy';`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 700. View `characters` Data

### 700.1

The command you just used does exactly what it sounds like. It finds the row where `name` is `Daisy`, and sets her `favorite_color` to `Orange`. Take a look all the data in your table again to see if she got updated.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all columns
- Try `SELECT * FROM characters;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 710. Update Toadstool's `name`

### 710.1

Her favorite color was updated. Toadstool's name is wrong as well, it's actually `Toad`. Use `UPDATE` to `SET` his `name` to `Toad`. Use the condition `favorite_color='Red'`.

#### HINTS

- Here's an example: `UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition;`
- Here's the second part of the command: `SET name='Toad' WHERE favorite_color='Red';`
- Try entering `UPDATE characters SET name='Toad' WHERE favorite_color='Red';`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 720. View `characters` Data

### 720.1

Take a look all the data in your table.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all columns
- Try `SELECT * FROM characters;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 730. Update Mario's `name`

### 730.1

Using `favorite_color='Red'` was not a good idea. Mario's name changed to Toad because he likes red, and now there's two rows that are the same. Well, almost. Only the `character_id` is different. You will have to use that to change it back to `Mario`. Use `UPDATE` to set the `name` to `Mario` for the row with the lowest `character_id`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `UPDATE`, `SET`, and `WHERE` keywords and strings where needed
- Here's an example: `UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition;`
- Try entering `UPDATE characters SET name='Mario' WHERE character_id=1;` in the psql prompt. Or whatever the correct `character_id` is.
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 740. View `characters` Data

### 740.1

Take a look all the data in your table again to see if Mario's name got changed back.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all columns
- Try `SELECT * FROM characters;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 750. Update Toad's `favorite_color`

### 750.1

Looks like it worked. Toad's favorite color is wrong. He likes blue. Change Toad's favorite color to `Blue`. Use whatever condition you want, but don't change any of the other rows.

#### HINTS

- Use the `UPDATE`, `SET`, and `WHERE` keywords
- Here's an example: `UPDATE table_name SET column_name=newvalue WHERE condition;`
- I recommend using `character_id=4` as the condition
- Try entering `UPDATE characters SET favorite_color='Blue' WHERE character_id=4;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 760. Update Bowser's `favorite_color`

### 760.1

Bowser's `favorite_color` is wrong. He likes `Yellow`. Why don't you update it without changing any of the other rows.

#### HINTS

- Use the `UPDATE`, `SET`, and `WHERE` keywords
- Here's an example: `UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition;`
- I recommend using `character_id=5` as the condition
- Try entering `UPDATE characters SET favorite_color='Yellow' WHERE character_id=5;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 770. Update Bowser's `homeland`

### 770.1

Bowser's `homeland` is wrong as well. He's from the `Koopa Kingdom`. Why don't you change it to that without changing any other rows.

#### HINTS

- Use the `UPDATE`, `SET`, and `WHERE` keywords
- Here's an example: `UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition;`
- I recommend using `character_id=5` as the condition
- Try entering `UPDATE characters SET homeland='Koopa Kingdom' WHERE character_id=5;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 780. View `characters` Data

### 780.1

Take a look all the data in your table again to make sure there's no more issues.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example; `SELECT rows FROM table_name;`
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM characters;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 790. View Sorted `characters` Data

### 790.1

Actually, you should put that in order. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT columns FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;
```

View all the data again, but put it in order by `character_id`.

#### HINTS

- Try entering `SELECT * FROM characters ORDER BY character_id;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 800. Add `name` Primary Key

### 800.1

It looks good. Next, you are going to add a **primary key**. It's a column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Here's an example of how to set a `PRIMARY KEY`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column_name);
```

The `name` column is pretty unique, why don't you set that as the primary key for this table.

#### HINTS

- You don't need quotes, but you do need a semi-colon :smile:
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE characters ADD PRIMARY KEY(name);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 810. View `characters` Details

### 810.1

You should set a primary key on every table and there can only be one per table. Take a look at the details of your `characters` table to see the primary key at the bottom.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d characters`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 820. Drop `name` Primary Key

### 820.1

You can see the key for your `name` column at the bottom. It would have been better to use `character_id` for the primary key. Here's an example of how to drop a constraint:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
```

Drop the primary key on the `name` column. You can see the **constraint name** is `characters_pkey`.

#### HINTS

- Try using `ALTER TABLE characters DROP CONSTRAINT characters_pkey;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 830. View `character` Details

### 830.1

View the details of the `characters` table to make sure it's gone.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d characters`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 840. Add `character_id` Primary Key

### 840.1

It's gone. Set the primary key again, but use the `character_id` column this time.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD PRIMARY KEY` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column_name);`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE characters ADD PRIMARY KEY(character_id);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 850. View `character` Details

### 850.1

View the details of the `characters` table to see the new primary key.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d characters`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 860. Create `more_info` Table

### 860.1

That's better. The table looks complete for now. Next, create a new table named `more_info` for some extra info about the characters.

#### HINTS

- Use the `CREATE TABLE` keywords
- Here's an example: `CREATE TABLE table_name();`
- Try entering `CREATE TABLE more_info();`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 870. View `mario_database` Tables

### 870.1

View the tables in `mario_database` again with the **d**isplay command. You should have two tables now.

#### HINTS

- Don't put a table name after the command
- Enter the `\d` command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 880. View `characters` Details

### 880.1

I wonder what that third one is. It says `characters_character_id_seq`. I think I have a clue. View the details of the `characters` table.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Add the table name after the command
- You previously used `\d second_table`
- Enter `\d characters`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 890. Create `more_info_id` Column

### 890.1

That is what finds the next value for the `character_id` column. Add a column to your new table named `more_info_id`. Make it a type of `SERIAL`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name TYPE;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE more_info ADD COLUMN more_info_id SERIAL;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 895. Create `more_info` Primary Key

### 895.1

Set your new column as the primary key for this table.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD PRIMARY KEY` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column_name);`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE more_info ADD PRIMARY KEY(more_info_id);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 900. View `mario_database` Tables

### 900.1

View the tables in `mario_database` again with the display command. There should be another sequence there for the `more_info_id` because it also automatically increments.

#### HINTS

- Enter the `\d` command
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 910. Add `birthday` Column

### 910.1

There it is. Add another column to `more_info` named `birthday`. Give it a data type of `DATE`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE more_info ADD COLUMN birthday DATE;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 920. Add `height` Column

### 920.1

Add a `height` column to `more_info` that's a type of `INT`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE more_info ADD COLUMN height INT;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 930. Add `weight` Columns

### 930.1

Add a `weight` column. Give it a type of `NUMERIC(4, 1)`. That data type is for decimals. `NUMERIC(4, 1)` has up to four digits and one of them has to be right of the decimal.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE more_info ADD COLUMN weight NUMERIC(4, 1);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 940. View `more_info` Details

### 940.1

Take a look at the details of `more_info` to see all your columns.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d more_info`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 950. Add `character_id` Foreign Key

### 950.1

There’s your four columns and the primary key you created at the bottom. To know what row a character is for, you need to set a **foreign key** so you can relate rows from this table to rows from your `characters` table. Here's an example that creates a column as a foreign key:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE REFERENCES referenced_table_name(referenced_column_name);
```

That's quite the command. In the `more_info` table, create a `character_id` column. Make it an `INT` and a foreign key that references the `character_id` column from the `characters` table. Good luck.

#### HINTS

- You can do it!
- Give it one more try
- Without the keywords, it looks like this: `more_info character_id characters(character_id);`
- Try this `ALTER TABLE more_info ADD COLUMN character_id INT REFERENCES characters(character_id);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 960. View `more_info` Details

### 960.1

To set a row in `more_info` for Mario, you just need to set the `character_id` (foreign key) value to whatever it is in the `characters` table. Take a look at the details of `more_info` to see your foreign key.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d more_info`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 970. Add `UNIQUE`

### 970.1

There's your foreign key at the bottom. These tables have a "one-to-one" relationship. **One** row in the `characters` table will be related to exactly **one** row in `more_info` and vice versa. Enforce that by adding the `UNIQUE` constraint to your foreign key. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE(column_name);
```

Add the `UNIQUE` constraint to the column you just added.

#### HINTS

- It's the `character_id` column in `more_info`
- Try `ALTER TABLE more_info ADD UNIQUE(character_id);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 980. Add `NOT NULL`

### 980.1

The column should also be `NOT NULL` since you don't want to have a row that is for nobody. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET NOT NULL;
```

Add the `NOT NULL` constraint to your foreign key column.

#### HINTS

- The foreign key column is `character_id` in the `more_info` table
- Try `ALTER TABLE more_info ALTER COLUMN character_id SET NOT NULL;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 990. View `more_info` Details

### 990.1

Take a look at the details of your `more_info` table to see all the keys and constraints you added.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d more_info`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1000. Select `character_id`

### 1000.1

The structure is set, now you can add some rows. First, you need to know what `character_id` you need for the foreign key column. You have viewed all columns in a table with `*`. You can pick columns by putting in the column name instead of `*`. Use `SELECT` to view the `character_id` column **from** the `characters` table.

#### HINTS

- Here's an example: `SELECT column FROM table_name;`
- Enter `SELECT character_id FROM characters;` in the psql prompt
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1010. Select `character_id` and `name`

### 1010.1

That list of numbers doesn't really help. Use `SELECT` again to display both the `character_id` and `name` columns from the `characters` table. You can separate the column names with a comma to view both.

#### HINTS

- Here's an example: `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;`
- Try entering `SELECT character_id, name FROM characters;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1020. Add `more_info` for Mario

### 1020.1

That's better. You can see Mario's id there. Here's some more info for him:

| birthday   | height | weight |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1981-07-09 | 155    | 64.5   |

Add a row to `more_info` with the above data for Mario using the `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES` keywords. Be sure to set his `character_id` when adding him. Also, `DATE` values need a string with the format: `'YYYY-MM-DD'`.

#### HINTS

- Here's an example: `INSERT INTO table_name(columns) VALUES(values);`
- You previously used `INSERT INTO characters(name, homeland, favorite_color) VALUES('Luigi', 'Mushroom Kingdom', 'Green');`
- Try `INSERT INTO more_info(birthday, height, weight, character_id) VALUES('1981-07-09', 155, 64.5, 1);`
- Or, enter the above command and replace the `1` with the correct `character_id`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1030. View `more_info` Data

### 1030.1

View all the data in `more_info` to make sure it's looking good.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM more_info;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1040. Select `character_id` and `name`

### 1040.1

Next, you are going to add some info for Luigi. Use `SELECT` again to view the `character_id` and `name` columns **from** the `characters` table to find his id.

#### HINTS

- Here's an example: `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;`
- Try entering `SELECT character_id, name FROM characters;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1050. Add `more_info` for Luigi

### 1050.1

You can see Luigi's id there. Here's his info:

| birthday   | height | weight |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1983-07-14 | 175    | 48.8   |

Add a row in `more_info` for Luigi using the above info. Be sure to add his `character_id` as well.

#### HINTS

- Use the `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES` keywords
- Be sure to put `DATE` values in quotes with the format: `'YYYY-MM-DD'`
- You previously used `INSERT INTO more_info(birthday, height, weight, character_id) VALUES('1981-07-09', 155, 64.5, 1);`
- Try `INSERT INTO more_info(birthday, height, weight, character_id) VALUES('1983-07-14', 175, 48.8, 2);`
- Or, enter the above command and replace the `2` with the correct `character_id`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1060. View `more_info` Data

### 1060.1

View all the data in `more_info` to see more info for Luigi.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to see all columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM more_info;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1070. Select `character_id` and `name`

- Here's an example: `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;`
- Try entering `SELECT character_id, name FROM characters;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1080. Add `more_info` for Peach

### 1080.1

Here's the additional info for Peach:

| birthday   | height | weight |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1985-10-18 | 173    | 52.2   |

Add a row for Peach using the above info. Be sure to add her `character_id` as well.

#### HINTS

- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1090. Select Toad's `character_id` and `name`

### 1090.1

Toad is next. Instead of viewing all the rows to find his id, you can just view his row with a `WHERE` condition. You used several earlier to delete and update rows. You can use it to view rows as well. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT columns FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

A condition you used before was `username='Samus'`. Find Toad's id by viewing the `character_id` and `name` columns from `characters` for only his row.

#### HINTS

- Don't forget the semi-colon :smile:
- Use `name='Toad'` for the condition
- Try entering `SELECT character_id, name FROM characters WHERE name='Toad';`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1100. Add `more_info` for Toad

### 1100.1

Here's what Toad's info looks like:

| birthday   | height | weight |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1950-01-10 | 66     | 35.6   |

Add the above info for Toad. Be sure to add his `character_id`.

#### HINTS

| birthday   | height | weight |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1990-04-13 | 162    | 59.1   |

Add the above info for Yoshi to `more_info`. Be sure to include his `character_id`.

#### HINTS

- You got this one!
- You previously used `INSERT INTO more_info(birthday, height, weight, character_id) VALUES('1989-07-31', NULL, NULL, 6);`
- Try `INSERT INTO more_info(birthday, height, weight, character_id) VALUES('1990-04-13', 162, 59.1, 7);`
- Or, enter the above command and replace the `7` with the correct `character_id`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1190. View all `more_info` Data

### 1190.1

There should be a lot of data in `more_info` now. Take a look at **all** the rows and columns in it.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Try `SELECT * FROM more_info;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1200. Rename `height` Column

### 1200.1

It looks good. There is something you can do to help out though. What units do the `height` and `weight` columns use? It's centimeters and kilograms, but nobody will know. Rename the `height` column to `height_in_cm`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE`, `RENAME COLUMN` and `TO` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name;`
- Try `ALTER TABLE more_info RENAME COLUMN height TO height_in_cm;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1210. Rename `weight` Column

### 1210.1

Rename the `weight` column to `weight_in_kg`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE`, `RENAME COLUMN` and `TO` keywords
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name;`
- Try `ALTER TABLE more_info RENAME COLUMN weight TO weight_in_kg;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1230. View all `more_info` Data

### 1230.1

Take a quick look at all the data in `more_info` to see the new column names.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Try `SELECT * FROM more_info;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1240. Create `sounds` Table

### 1240.1

Next, you will make a `sounds` table that holds filenames of sounds the characters make. You created your other tables similar to this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name();
```

Inside those parenthesis you can put columns for a table so you don't need to add them with a separate command, like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name(column_name DATATYPE CONSTRAINTS);
```

Create a new table named `sounds`. Give it a column named `sound_id` of type `SERIAL` and a contraint of `PRIMARY KEY`.

#### HINTS

- Try entering `CREATE TABLE sounds(sound_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1260. View `mario_database` Tables

### 1260.1

View the tables in `mario_database` to make sure it worked.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Try entering `\d`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1270. Add `filename` Column

### 1270.1

There's your `sounds` table. Add a column to it named `filename`. Make it a `VARCHAR` that has a max length of `40` and with constraints of `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`. You can put those contraints at the end of the query to add them all.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- Give it three properties: `VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL UNIQUE`
- Here's an example: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE CONSTRAINTS;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE sounds ADD COLUMN filename VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL UNIQUE;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1280. Add `sounds` Foreign Key

### 1280.1

You want to use `character_id` as a foreign key again. This will be a "one-to-many" relationship because **one** character will have **many** sounds, but no sound will have more than one character. Here's the example again:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE CONSTRAINT REFERENCES referenced_table_name(referenced_column_name);
```

Add a column to `sounds` named `character_id`. Give it the properties `INT`, `NOT NULL`, and set it as a foreign key that references `character_id` from `characters`.

#### HINTS

- You can do this!
- Give it one more try, take a close look at all those values and keywords
- Without the keywords, it looks like this: `sounds character_id characters(character_id);`
- Try using `ALTER TABLE sounds ADD COLUMN character_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES characters(character_id);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1290. View `sounds ` Details

### 1290.1

Take a look at the details of the `sounds` table to see all the columns.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay shortcut command
- Here's an example: `\d table_name`
- Try entering `\d sounds`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1300. View `characters` Data

### 1300.1

Next you will add some rows. But first, view all the data in `characters` so you can find the correct id's again. **Order** them **by** `character_id` like you did earlier.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name ORDER BY column;`
- Use `*` to select all the columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM characters ORDER BY character_id;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1310. Insert `its-a-me.wav`

### 1310.1

The first file is named `its-a-me.wav`. Insert it into the `sounds` table with Mario's id as the `character_id`.

#### HINTS

- Don't for get the quotes
- Use `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES` keywords
- Here's an example: `INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value_1, value_2);`
- Try `INSERT INTO sounds(filename, character_id) VALUES('its-a-me.wav', 1);`
- Or, enter the above command and replace the `1` with the correct `character_id`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1320. Insert `yippee.wav`

### 1320.1

Add another row with a `filename` of `yippee.wav`. Use Mario's `character_id` again for the foreign key value.

#### HINTS

- Don't forget the quotes
- You previously used: `INSERT INTO sounds(filename, character_id) VALUES('its-a-me.wav', 1);`
- Try entering `INSERT INTO sounds(filename, character_id) VALUES('yippee.wav', 1);`
- Or, enter the above command and replace the `1` with the correct `character_id`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1330. Insert `ha-ha.wav`

### 1330.1

Add another row to `sounds` for Luigi named `ha-ha.wav`. Use his `character_id` this time. Take a look at the data in `characters` to find his id if you need to.

#### HINTS

- You previously used: `INSERT INTO sounds(filename, character_id) VALUES('its-a-me.wav', 1);`
- Try entering `INSERT INTO sounds(filename, character_id) VALUES('ha-ha.wav', 2);`
- Or, enter the above command and replace the `2` with the correct `character_id`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1340. Insert `oh-yeah.wav`

### 1340.1

Add another row with a filename of `oh-yeah.wav`. This one is for Luigi as well so use his `character_id` again.

#### HINTS

- Try `INSERT INTO sounds(filename, character_id) VALUES('oh-yeah.wav', 2);`
- Or, enter the above command and replace the `2` with the correct `character_id`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1350. Insert Sounds for Peach

### 1350.1

Add two more rows for Peach sounds. The filenames are `yay.wav` and `woo-hoo.wav`. Don't forget her `character_id`. Try to do it with one command.

#### HINTS

- Here's an example: `INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value_1, value_2), (value_1, value_2);`
- Find her `character_id` by viewing data in the `characters` table
- Try `INSERT INTO sounds(filename, character_id) VALUES('yay.wav', 3), ('woo-hoo.wav', 3);`
- Or, enter the above command and replace the `3` with the correct `character_id`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1360. Insert Two More Sounds

### 1360.1

Add two more rows. The filenames are `mm-hmm.wav` and `yahoo.wav`. The first one is for Peach again, the second is for Mario, so use the correct foreign key values. Try to do it with one command.

#### HINTS

- Here's an example: `INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value_1, value_2), (value_1, value_2);`
- Find their `character_id` by viewing data in the `characters` table
- Try `INSERT INTO sounds(filename, character_id) VALUES('mm-hmm.wav', 3), ('yahoo.wav', 1);`
- Or, enter the above command and replace the `3` and `1` with the correct `character_id`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1370. View `sounds` Data

### 1370.1

View all the data in the `sounds`. You should be able to see the "one-to-many" relationship better. One character has many sounds.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to select all the columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM sounds;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1380. Create `actions` Table

### 1380.1

See the "one-to-many" relationship? Create another new table called `actions`. Give it a column named `action_id` that's a type of `SERIAL`, and make it the `PRIMARY KEY`. Try to create the table and add the column with one command.

#### HINTS

- Use `CREATE TABLE`, `SERIAL`, and `PRIMARY KEY`
- You previously used `CREATE TABLE sounds(sound_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY);`
- Try entering `CREATE TABLE actions(action_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1390. Add `action` Column

### 1390.1

Add a column named `action` to your new table. Give it a type of `VARCHAR` that is a max length of `20` and has `UNIQUE` and `NOT NULL` constraints.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- You previously used `ALTER TABLE sounds ADD COLUMN filename VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL UNIQUE;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE actions ADD COLUMN action VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1400. Insert `run`

### 1400.1

The actions table won't have any foreign keys. It's going to have a "many-to-many" relationship with the characters table. This is because **many** of the characters can perform **many** actions. You will see why you don't need a foreign key later. Insert a row into the `actions` table. Give it an `action` of `run`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES` keywords
- Don't forget the single quotes
- Here's an example `INSERT INTO table(column) VALUES(value);`
- Try entering `INSERT INTO actions(action) VALUES('run');`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1410. Insert `jump`

### 1410.1

Insert another row into the `actions` table. Give it an `action` of `jump`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES` keywords
- Don't forget the single quotes
- You previously used `INSERT INTO actions(action) VALUES('run');`
- Try entering `INSERT INTO actions(action) VALUES('jump');`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1420. Insert `duck`

### 1420.1

Add another action row with an `action` of `duck`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES` keywords
- Don't forget the single quotes
- You previously used `INSERT INTO actions(action) VALUES('jump');`
- Try entering `INSERT INTO actions(action) VALUES('duck');`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1430. View `actions` Data

### 1430.1

View all the data in `actions` to make sure there's no mistakes.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to select all the columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM actions;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1440. Create Junction Table

### 1440.1

It look good. "Many-to-many" relationships usually use a **junction** table to link two tables together, forming two "one-to-many" relationships. Your `characters` and `actions` table will be linked using a junction table. Create a new table called `character_actions`. It will describe what actions each character can perform.

#### HINTS

- Use the `CREATE TABLE` keywords
- You previously used `CREATE TABLE more_info();`
- Try entering `CREATE TABLE character_actions();`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1450. Add `character_id` Column

### 1450.1

Your junction table will use the primary keys from the `characters` and `actions` tables as foreign keys to create the relationship. Add a column named `character_id` to your junction table. Give it the type of `INT` and constraint of `NOT NULL`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- You previously used: `ALTER TABLE actions ADD COLUMN name VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE character_actions ADD COLUMN character_id INT NOT NULL;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1460. Add `character_id` as Foreign Key

### 1460.1

The foreign keys you set before were added when you created the column. You can set an existing column as a foreign key like this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD FOREIGN KEY(column_name) REFERENCES referenced_table(referenced_column);
```

Set the `character_id` column you just added as a foreign key that references the `character_id` from the `characters` table.

#### HINTS

- Without the keywords, it looks like this: `character_actions character_id characters(character_id);`
- All the info you need is there, read it closely
- Try this: `ALTER TABLE character_actions ADD FOREIGN KEY(character_id) REFERENCES characters(character_id);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1470. View `character_actions` Details

### 1470.1

View the details of the `character_actions` table to see the foreign key you added.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay command
- Add the table name after the command
- Enter `\d character_actions`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1480. Add `action_id` Column

### 1480.1

Add another column to `character_actions` named `action_id`. Give it a type of `INT` and constraint of `NOT NULL`.

#### HINTS

- Use the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` keywords
- You previously used: `ALTER TABLE character_actions ADD COLUMN character_id INT NOT NULL;`
- Try entering `ALTER TABLE character_actions ADD COLUMN action_id INT NOT NULL;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1500. Add `action_id` as Foreign Key

### 1500.1

This will be a foreign key as well. Set the `action_id` column you just added as a foreign key that references the `action_id` column from the `actions` table.

#### HINTS

- Here's the example again: `ALTER TABLE table_name ADD FOREIGN KEY(column_name) REFERENCES referenced_table(referenced_column);`
- Without the keywords, it looks like this: `character_actions action_id actions(action_id);`
- You previously used: `ALTER TABLE characters_actions ADD FOREIGN KEY(character_id) REFERENCES characters(character_id);`
- Here it is `ALTER TABLE character_actions ADD FOREIGN KEY(action_id) REFERENCES actions(action_id);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1510. View `character_actions` Details

### 1510.1

View the details of the `character_actions` table to see your keys.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay command
- Add the table name after the command
- Enter `\d character_actions`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1520. Create Composite Primary Key

### 1520.1

Every table should have a primary key. Your previous tables had a single column as a primary key. This one will be different. You can create a primary key from two columns, known as a **composite** primary key. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column1, column2);
```

Use `character_id` and `action_id` to create a composite primary key for this table.

#### HINTS

- Try `ALTER TABLE character_actions ADD PRIMARY KEY(character_id, action_id);`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1530. View `character_actions` Details

### 1530.1

This table will have multiple rows with the same `character_id`, and multiple rows the same `action_id`. So neither of them are unique. But you will never have the same `character_id` and `action_id` in a single row. So the two columns together can be used to uniquely identify each row. View the details of the `character_actions` table to see your composite key.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay command
- Add the table name after the command
- Enter `\d character_actions`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1540. Insert Yoshi Actions

### 1540.1

Insert three rows into `character_actions` for all the actions Yoshi can perform. He can perform all of them in the `actions` table. View the data in the `characters` and `actions` table to find the correct id's for the information.

#### HINTS

- Use the `INSERT INTO` and `VALUES` keywords
- Here's an example: `INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value_1, value_2), (value_1, value_2);`
- Try `INSERT INTO character_actions(character_id, action_id) VALUES(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3);`
- Or, enter the above command and use the correct ID's
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1550. View `character_actions` Data

### 1550.1

View all the data in `character_actions` to see your rows.

#### HINTS

#### HINTS

- Add a row into `character_actions` for each action `Mario` can perform
- View the data in the `characters` and `actions` table to find the correct id's for the information.
- Here's an example: `INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value_1, value_2), (value_1, value_2);`
- You previously used `INSERT INTO character_actions(character_id, action_id) VALUES(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)`

- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1620. View `character_actions` Data

### 1620.1

That was a lot of work. View all the data in `character_actions` to see the rows you ended up with.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to select all the columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM character_actions;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1630. Display Tables

### 1630.1

Well done. The database is complete for now. Take a look around to see what you ended up with. First, display all the tables you created.

#### HINTS

- Use the **d**isplay command
- Enter `\d`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1640. View `characters` Data

### 1640.1

There's five tables there. Nice job. Next, take a look at all the data in the `characters` table.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to select all the columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM characters;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1650. View `more_info` Data

### 1650.1

Those are some lovely characters. View all the data in the `more_info` table.

#### HINTS

- Use the `SELECT` and `FROM` keywords
- Here's an example: `SELECT columns FROM table_name;`
- Use `*` to select all the columns
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM more_info;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1660. Full Join `characters` on `more_info`

### 1660.1

You can see the `character_id` there so you just need to find the matching id in the `characters` table to find out who it's for. Or... You added that as a foreign key, that means you can get all the data from both tables with a `JOIN` command:

```sql
SELECT columns FROM table_1 FULL JOIN table_2 ON table_1.primary_key_column = table_2.foreign_key_column;
```

Enter a join command to see **all** the info from both tables. The two tables are `characters` and `more_info`. The columns are the `character_id` column from both tables since those are the linked keys.

#### HINTS

- Use `*` to see all the columns
- Give it one more try, read closely
- Without the keywords, it looks like this: `characters more_info characters.character_id = more_info.character_id`
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM characters FULL JOIN more_info ON characters.character_id = more_info.character_id;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1670. Full Join `characters` on `sounds`

### 1670.1

Now you can see all the info from both tables. If you recall, that's a "one-to-one" relationship. So there's one row in each table that matches a row from the other. Use another `JOIN` command to view the `characters` and `sounds` tables together. They both use the `character_id` column for their keys as well.

#### HINTS

- Here's the example again: `SELECT columns FROM table_1 FULL JOIN table_2 ON table_1.primary_key_column = table_2.foreign_key_column;`
- Use `*` to see all the columns
- You previously used `SELECT * FROM characters FULL JOIN more_info ON characters.character_id = more_info.character_id;`
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM characters FULL JOIN sounds ON characters.character_id = sounds.character_id;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already

## 1680. Join `character_actions` with `characters` and `actions`

### 1680.1

This shows the "one-to-many" relationship. You can see that some of the characters have more than one row because they have **many** sounds. How can you see all the info from the `characters`, `actions`, and `character_actions` tables? Here's an example that joins three tables:

```sql
SELECT columns FROM junction_table
FULL JOIN table_1 ON junction_table.foreign_key_column = table_1.primary_key_column
FULL JOIN table_2 ON junction_table.foreign_key_column = table_2.primary_key_column;
```

Congratulations on making it this far. This is the last step. View all the data from `characters`, `actions`, and `character_actions` by joining all three tables. When you see the data, be sure to check the "many-to_many" relationship. Many characters will have many actions.

#### HINTS

- Use the `character_id` column to join `character_actions` and `characters`
- Use the `action_id` column to join `character_actions` and `actions`
- Without the keywords, it looks like this: `character_actions characters character_actions.character_id = characters.character_id actions character_actions.action_id = actions.action_id;`
- Try entering `SELECT * FROM character_actions FULL JOIN characters ON character_actions.character_id = characters.character_id FULL JOIN actions ON character_actions.action_id = actions.action_id;`
- Enter `psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=mario_database` into the terminal to log in if you aren't already
- If the tests aren't running automatically, quit psql with `\q` and try logging in again
